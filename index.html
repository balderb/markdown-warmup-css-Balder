<h2>You can always count on me when in doubt about some code or program! Let's google-fu it together!</h2>  

<p>I'm an enthusastic and empathic co-worker, always in for a challenge and hands-on mentality!</p>

<h2>Here is a funny story</h2> 

<p>When i was in the 4th grade we were supposed to do homework in group once. It was about writing some poem. My friend and I made it in the garden of the school 5 minutes before class, of course.
<br>Once it was finally finished we rushed over the campus to be on time, homework in my hand, lost it in the wind and the homework flew away.
We still laugh with it until now. <br> Long story short, the teacher never believed us that the homework was gone with the wind. This is not made up. </p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2> 

<p>When my homework flew away</p>
